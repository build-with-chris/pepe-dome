## The Problem

### Fragmented Event Communication
Pepe Dome hosts weekly shows, workshops, and events, but there's no centralized platform to showcase this diverse programming. Potential attendees miss events because they don't know about them, and the editorial team spends excessive time manually creating newsletters and managing communications.

**Our Solution:** An integrated digital platform that automatically aggregates events into monthly newsletters, provides a browsable news and events hub, and streamlines content management through an intuitive admin interface.

### Inefficient Audience Growth
Without a systematic way to collect and nurture email subscribers, Pepe Dome struggles to build a loyal community and ensure consistent event attendance. Manual processes make it difficult to segment audiences or measure engagement.

**Our Solution:** GDPR-compliant email collection with double opt-in, automatic monthly newsletter generation from event data, and analytics to track subscriber growth and engagement metrics.

## Differentiators

### Automated Newsletter Generation
Unlike traditional newsletter tools that require manual content creation, we automatically generate HTML newsletters and landing pages from event data. This reduces editorial workload by 80% while maintaining professional quality and consistent formatting.

### Integrated Content Ecosystem
Rather than maintaining separate systems for news, events, and email marketing, our platform unifies all content types with smart cross-linking. An event can be featured in news articles, automatically included in newsletters, and accessible through calendar views - all from a single data source.

### Editorial Control with Automation Benefits
Unlike fully automated systems that sacrifice quality, our platform generates newsletter drafts that editors can review, customize, and test before sending. This combines the efficiency of automation with the human touch of editorial curation.

### Theatre-Inspired Design System
Our warm golden theatre lighting design creates an emotional connection that reflects the magic of live performance. Unlike generic event platforms, every interaction feels like stepping into a spotlight - creating memorable experiences that keep audiences engaged.
